Object Detection &amp; Area Evaluation System &amp; Mapping

## About
The ODAE will detect and measure the area of a shape positioned between 0.9 â€“1.3 meters from the microprocessor heading.The object will be entirely mapped by scanning the following range: +/-50 degree azimuth  and +/-25 degrees elevation. It should also provide the distance to the closest point. The planar object will fit in a rectangular area smaller than 40cm by 40cm and in the centre will be perpendicular to the scanner unit in one azimuth orientation within the scanning area. There will be two different objects. One of the objects will have a rectangular shape and no holes. The other object will have polygonal shape and potential holes.  

The Dragon12 Plus 2 Board will control a Pan and Tilt Unit (PTU) to scan the object and output the data to the PC in real-time (online) or offline using the serial port in a correct format and calibration. The output data is to be processed through MATLAB for a final shape plot/map. The system will be user interface and configurable via the Board (using the keypad as input and the LCD and 7 segment display as outputs) or via the PC using MATLAB.
